about=This plugin allows users to download Sentinel-2 images from Copernicus Data Space platform (https://dataspace.copernicus.eu). Images can be downloaded as bands or raw zip file. The plugin also has ability to create various indices. Another option is to download only "quicklook" image (RGB image with lower resolution and size) instead of Sentinel-2 data. Analysis consists of three processes. "Download Footprints", "Download Images" and "Select Images". In "Download Footprints" section footprints of the images are retrieved based on given conditions (such as date, query area, max cloud etc.) In "Download Images" section credentials are provided and images are downloaded based on some options(such as bands to be downloaded, indices etc). "Select Images" section is optional. In this section; footprints can be filtered using quicklook file and saved as new geopackage file.
