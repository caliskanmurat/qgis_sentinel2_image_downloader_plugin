about=This plugin allows users to download Sentinel-2 images from Copernicus Data Space platform (https://dataspace.copernicus.eu). Images can be downloaded as bands or raw zip file. The plugin also has ability to create various indices. Another option is to download only "quicklook" image (RGB image without coordinate refererence system) instead of Sentinel-2 data. Analysis consists of two processes. "Download Footprints" and "Download Images". In "Download Footprints" section footprints of the images are retrieved based on given conditions (such as date, query area, max cloud etc.) "In Download Images" section credentials are provided images are downloaded based on some options(such as bands to be downloaded, indices etc).
